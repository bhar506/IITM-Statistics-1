<h1>Introduction to Statistics</h1>

<p>
  Statistics is the art of learning from data which includes collection of data, analysis of data and drawing conclusions from     data.
</p>

<h3>Major Branches of Statistics</h3>
<ol>
  <b><li>Descriptive Statistics</li></b>
  <p>The part of statistics concerned with description and summarization of data is known as descriptive statistics.</p>
  <b><li>Inferential Statistics</li></b>
  <p>
    The part of statistics concerned with drawing of conclusions is known as inferential statistics. We must take into account      the possibility of chance</p>
</ol>
<hr/>
<h3>Population and Sample</h3>
<ol>
  <b><li>Population</li></b>
  <p>
    The total collection of all elements is known as population.
  </p>
  <b><li>Sample</li></b>
  <p>
    Subset/subgroup of population is known as sample. Sample must be as representative as possible.
  </p>
</ol>
<hr/>
<h3>Purpose of Statistical Analysis</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    If the purpose of statistics is just to examine and explore the information for it's own intrinsic interest only, the   
    study is descriptive. Descriptive statistics can be performed either on a sample or population.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the purpose of the analysis is to draw conclusions about population based on the information obtained from sample.        Then the study is inferential
  </li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<h3>Introduction and types of data</h3>
<p>
  Data are the facts and figures collected, analyzed and summarized for presentation and interpretation.
</p>
<h4>Variables and Cases</h4>
<ol>
  <b><li>Variables</li></b>
  <p>
    A characteristic/attribute that varies across all units. Columns represent variables. For each variables, same type of       value is recorded.
  </p>
  <b><li>Cases</li></b>
  <p>
    A unit from which data are collected. Row represent cases. For each case, same attribute is recorded.
  </p>
</ol>
<p>
  Each variable must have it's own column. Each observation must have it's own row.
</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Classification of Data</h3>
<ol>
  <b><li>Categorical</li></b>
  <ul>
    <li>Qualitative data</li>
    <li>identifies group membership</li>
  </ul>
  <b><li>Numerical</li></b>
  <ul>
    <li>Quantitative</li>
    <li>describe numerical properties of cases</li>
    <li>Have measurement units</li>
    <li>Numerical data can be further classified into discrete and continuous</li>
  </ul>
</ol>
<hr/>
<h3>Cross Sectional and Time Series</h3>
<ol>
  <b><li>Time Series</li></b>
  <p>Data recorded over a period of time. Graph of a time series showing values in chronological order</p>
  <b><li>Cross Sectional</li></b>
  <p>Data recorded at the same time.</p>
</ol>
<hr/>
<h3>Scales of measurement</h3>
<ol>
  <b><li>Nominal</li></b>
  <p>
    When data for a variable consist of labels or names used to identify the characteristic of an observation, the scale of      measurement is considered as nominal scale.
    For eg name,gender, blood group etc.
    Sometimes nominal data can be numerically coded. For eg we might code female as 1 and male as 0. 
    <b>Nominal: Name categories without implying order</b>
  </p>
  <b><li>Ordinal</li></b>
  <p>
    Data exhibits the properties of nominal but here rank or order is meaningful. The scale of measurement is considered to      be as ordinal data.
    <b>Named categories that can be ordered</b>
  </p>
  <b><li>Interval</li></b>
  <p>
    Data have all the properties of ordinal data and interval between the value is expressed in terms of a fixed unit of a      measure, then scale of measurement is called interval scale.Interval data are always numeric and can find out       
    difference between two values. Ratio does not have any meaning here.
    <b>Interval: Numeric values can be added or subtracted(no absolute zero)</b>
  </p>
  <b><li>Ratio</li></b>
  <p>
    Have all properties of interval but ratio is meaning ful here. Can perform arithmetic operation.
  </p>
</ol>
