<h3>Major Branches of Statistics</h3>
<ol>
  <b><li>Descriptive Statistics</li></b>
  <p>The part of statistics concerned with description and summarization of data is known as descriptive statistics.</p>
  <b><li>Inferential Statistics</li></b>
  <p>
    The part of statistics concerned with drawing of conclusions is known as inferential statistics. We must take into account      the possibility of chance</p>
</ol>
<hr/>
<h3>Population and Sample</h3>
<ol>
  <b><li>Population</li></b>
  <p>
    The total collection of all elements is known as population.
  </p>
  <b><li>Sample</li></b>
  <p>
    Subset/subgroup of population is known as sample. Sample must be as representative as possible.
  </p>
</ol>

<h3>Purpose of Statistical Analysis</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    If the purpose of statistics is just to examine and explore the information for it's own intrinsic interest only, the   
    study is descriptive. Descriptive statistics can be performed either on a sample or population.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the purpose of the analysis is to draw conclusions about population based on the information obtained from sample.        Then the study is inferential
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Introduction and types of data</h3>
<p>
  Data are the facts and figures collected, analyzed and summarized for presentation and interpretation.
</p>
<h4>Variables and Cases</h4>
<ol>
  <b><li>Variables</li></b>
  <p>
    A characteristic/attribute that varies across all units. Columns represent variables. For each variables, same type of       value is recorded.
  </p>
  <b><li>Cases</li></b>
  <p>
    A unit from which data are collected. Row represent cases. For each case, same attribute is recorded.
  </p>
</ol>
<p>
  Each variable must have it's own column. Each observation must have it's own row.
